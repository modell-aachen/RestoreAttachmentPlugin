---+ package Foswiki::Plugins::RestoreAttachmentPlugin

When developing a plugin it is important to remember that
Foswiki is tolerant of plugins that do not compile. In this case,
the failure will be silent but the plugin will not be available.
See %SYSTEMWEB%.InstalledPlugins for error messages.

__NOTE:__ Foswiki:Development.StepByStepRenderingOrder helps you decide which
rendering handler to use. When writing handlers, keep in mind that these may
be invoked on included topics. For example, if a plugin generates links to the
current topic, these need to be generated before the =afterCommonTagsHandler=
is run. After that point in the rendering loop we have lost the information
that the text had been included from another topic.

__NOTE:__ Not all handlers (and not all parameters passed to handlers) are
available with all versions of Foswiki. Where a handler has been added
the POD comment will indicate this with a "Since" line
e.g. *Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 1.1

Deprecated handlers are still available, and can continue to be used to
maintain compatibility with earlier releases, but will be removed at some
point in the future. If you do implement deprecated handlers, then you can
do no harm by simply keeping them in your code, but you are recommended to
implement the alternative as soon as possible.

See http://foswiki.org/Download/ReleaseDates for a breakdown of release
versions.

# $VERSION is referred to by Foswiki, and is the only global variable that
# *must* exist in this package. This should always be in the format
# $Rev: 8536 $ so that Foswiki can determine the checked-in status of the
# extension.
our $VERSION = '$Rev: 8536 $';

# $RELEASE is used in the "Find More Extensions" automation in configure.
# It is a manually maintained string used to identify functionality steps.
# You can use any of the following formats:
# tuple   - a sequence of integers separated by . e.g. 1.2.3. The numbers
#           usually refer to major.minor.patch release or similar. You can
#           use as many numbers as you like e.g. '1' or '1.2.3.4.5'.
# isodate - a date in ISO8601 format e.g. 2009-08-07
# date    - a date in 1 Jun 2009 format. Three letter English month names only.
# Note: it's important that this string is exactly the same in the extension
# topic - if you use %$RELEASE% with BuildContrib this is done automatically.
our $RELEASE = '1.1.1';

# Short description of this plugin
# One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
our $SHORTDESCRIPTION = 'Restoring Attachments';

# You must set $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC to 0 if you want your plugin to use
# preferences set in the plugin topic. This is required for compatibility
# with older plugins, but imposes a significant performance penalty, and
# is not recommended. Instead, leave $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC at 1 and use
# =$Foswiki::cfg= entries, or if you want the users
# to be able to change settings, then use standard Foswiki preferences that
# can be defined in your %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences and overridden at the web
# and topic level.
#
# %SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins has details of how to define =$Foswiki::cfg=
# entries so they can be used with =configure=.

---++ initPlugin($topic, $web, $user) -> $boolean
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$user= - the login name of the user
   * =$installWeb= - the name of the web the plugin topic is in
     (usually the same as =$Foswiki::cfg{SystemWebName}=)

*REQUIRED*

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using =Foswiki::Func::writeWarning= and return 0. In this case
%<nop>FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

__Note:__ Please align macro names with the Plugin name, e.g. if
your Plugin is called !FooBarPlugin, name macros FOOBAR and/or
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.
